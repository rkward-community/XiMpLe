Description: GNU R package "A Simple XML Tree Parser and Generator"
 .
 Provides a simple XML tree parser/generator. It includes functions to read XML files into R objects, get information out of and into
 nodes, and write R objects back to XML code. It's not as powerful as the 'XML' package and doesn't aim to be, but for simple XML
 handling it could be useful. It was originally developed for the R GUI and IDE 'RKWard' <https://rkward.kde.org>, to make plugin
 development easier.
